Scripts for creating indexes from Wiktionary. Currently only the English
Wiktionary is supported, but that doesn't have to be the case.

Many of these scripts require wikitextlib, which can be found at
<https://github.com/ziplantil/wikitextlib>.

The scripts here consist of three parts:
* util - General utilities for specific languages. Identified by a 
  ISO 639 code with one set of utilities for each language. See UTILINFO
  for the functions that util must implement for every language.
  There is also a util.definitions for some definitions.
* extract - Extracts data from Wiktionary and return a file in a
  word index XML format (see specifications under XMLINDEX). extraction
  has two subcomponents:
  * find - finds pages to parse and passes the appropriate contents (L2)
           to parse. These scripts are identified by the site and the
           means of input, which can be:
           - pwb - pywikibot. Uses pywikibot to get a list of pages from
                   a category, finds contents under a specific heading
                   and passes to parse.
                   requires pywikibot and wikitextlib.
           - xml - extracts entries from a MediaWiki XML dump.
                   requires wikitextlib.
           For example, find_enwikt_pwb finds entries from the English
           Wiktionary by using pywikibot.
  * parse - parses an entry and possibly emits an entry for the index.
    These scripts are identified by the site and the language code. For
    example, parse_enwikt_fi parses Finnish entries from en.wiktionary.
  The extract script takes in a site id (such as enwikt), language code
  and means of extraction (pwb, xml, etc.) as parameters, the output
  XML file and optional parameters (which are passed to find by default,
  but some named parameters may end up to parse).

  indexgen.py extract <site> <lang> <method> <out-xml> [...]

* format - Takes in a word index in XML format, as given by extract, and
  formats it into an index.
  - format_enwikt_pwb   takes in a header and dumps a formatted index
                        through pywikibot. formatting is in English and
                        optimized for the English Wiktionary.
                        requires pywikibot and wikitextlib.
  - format_enwikt_txt   takes in a header and dumps a formatted index
                        as text files containing wikitext.
                        formatting is in English and
                        optimized for the English Wiktionary.
                        requires pywikibot and wikitextlib.
  And so on, where enwikt can also be replaced with something else
  (provided the script exists).
  In addition, there might be other forms of output, such as
  - format_en_html      English language HTML output.
  The format script takes in a XML and the formatter (without format_), as well
  as optional addition parameters (passed to format).

  indexgen.py format <xml> <formatter> [...]
